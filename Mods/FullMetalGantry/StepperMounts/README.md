# Modifications – Stepper Tower Spacers

I modified the **Stepper Tower Spacers** to work with **hex spacers** instead of round spacers.  
These modified parts have been tested with my personal hardware and are confirmed to work reliably.

## Future Support
I may eventually add support for the other **Stepper Tower options** so that users can choose whichever setup fits their build best.

## Print Settings
Please use the official **ZeroG print settings** for best results:

## Images

Here are some example images showing what the modified spacers look like in practice:

## Notes
This modification is based on the original ZeroG Mercury One.1 design.  
It has only been tested with my own hardware setup — results may vary depending on tolerances.
